# Democracy
Republicanism v. Democracy
- From Enlightenment potilical theories, utilitarian, Marxist, Social Contract, based on scientific principles,it will vindicate individual freedom by doctine of individual rights
- Anti-Enlightenment, human beings are products of their histories and contexts and their pschologies are intrinsically connected to others in ways that are under estimated by Enlightment thinkers.
=> Democratic tradition delivers better on a chastened enlightenment view.

## Defination of Democracy
- Rule by the people; Majority rule; The general will; Equal power; Political competition; Non-domination; Principle of affected interest (against patriarchal or military system); Seems people identify it with all good things??
- A family resemblance concept (Less demanding than the idea of universal defination)
Democracy made famous by its critics~~
- Plato,
virulent critic of democracy, Athens had decided to put to death his mentor Socrates;
Hostility to Truth (emotivist culture, science of manipulating the people)
> *-- Plato, The Republic*

- Alex de Tocqueville
the tyranny of the majority, democracy and equality were ideas that were historically unstoppable, their time had arrived. They are going to take over the world.
learn how to ride the elephant rather than be stampeded by it.
Fear of Majority Tyranny (Republic)
> *-- Tocqueville, Democracy in America*

Politics based on science?
Respect for individual rights?

American founders were so distrustful of the idea of majortiy rule that they constructed these instuitions to hem it in and make it very difficulty for the majority to function.  

## In search of General Will

> there is often a great difference between the will of all and the general will; the general will studies only the common interest while the will of all studies private interest, and is indeed no more than the sum of individual desires. But if we take away from all these same wills, the pluses and minuses which cancel each other out, the balance which remains is the general will. 
>
> *-- Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Social Contract*

Voting cycle paradox

## Habermas' Deliberative Ideal

Solution:
- Deliberation, manufacturing the general will rather than discovering it.

#### Habermas' ideal speech situation
1. everyone has an equal opportuinity to participate
2. everyone is free to assert, defend, or question any fractual or normative claim
3. no one can be coerced into curtailing the rights specified in 1 & 2
4. everyone is motivated solely by the desire to reach an agreement about the truth of statements and the validity of norms
in sum, the most persuasive point of view prevails
##### a little bit demanding
- Assume it is possible for people to agree about political fundamentals
- Assume people are motivated to agree about political fundamentals
“Overlapping consensus” gives up on reasons(Rawls, Sunstein, Sen)

### Deliberation can undermine agreement
- Marriage Therapy
- Marx on consciousness raising
- “Gag rules” and taking things of the table   
(Stephen Holmes, get religious out of politics, it's too intense, if people trying to be brought to agree on these things, all you get is war, wars of religion 17th century)
(1872 after civil war, Democratic Party, let do not reopen any questions, and draw a line and move on; Republic Party, they should be cordially sustained becaseu they are right, not merely law)
