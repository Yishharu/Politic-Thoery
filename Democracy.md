# Democracy
Republicanism v. Democracy
- From Enlightenment potilical theories, utilitarian, Marxist, Social Contract, based on scientific principles,it will vindicate individual freedom by doctine of individual rights
- Anti-Enlightenment, human beings are products of their histories and contexts and their pschologies are intrinsically connected to others in ways that are under estimated by Enlightment thinkers.
=> Democratic tradition delivers better on a chastened enlightenment view.

## Defination of Democracy
- Rule by the people; Majority rule; The general will; Equal power; Political competition; Non-domination; Principle of affected interest (against patriarchal or military system); Seems people identify it with all good things??
- A family resemblance concept (Less demanding than the idea of universal defination)
Democracy made famous by its critics~~
- Plato,
virulent critic of democracy, Athens had decided to put to death his mentor Socrates;
Hostility to Truth (emotivist culture, science of manipulating the people)
> *-- Plato, The Republic*

- Alex de Tocqueville
the tyranny of the majority, democracy and equality were ideas that were historically unstoppable, their time had arrived. They are going to take over the world.
learn how to ride the elephant rather than be stampeded by it.
Fear of Majority Tyranny (Republic)
> *-- Tocqueville, Democracy in America*

Politics based on science?
Respect for individual rights?
