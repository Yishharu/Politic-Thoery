## Anti-Enlightenment

Burkean Outlook
Irish, Edmund  Burke (1729 - 1797), conservative (time-heritage)

Outlook
Hostility to science (1789 French Revolution, rebuild the whole regime) Aristotle
Decentering of the individual (Kennedy)

Burke’s selection on the French Revolution

Time could change
Value of Caution

Conservative is not reactionary

Campare Robert Peel

Lord Patrick Devlin
Morals and the criminal law.   (Report on homosexuality and prostitution, should be legal) 1957
A sociological theory, not a philosophical theory

The public absorb the public morality, which has intolerance, indignation and disgust, tells you a line that you cannot cross if you are thinking about change.

The law should evolve to accord with the morals and culture of a society. (According to Devlin)

Try to do without justifying individual rights is even harder

Contemporary communitarianism. (Alasdair Maclntyre)
Marx better than Christianity, —> Disappointed Marxist, —> Disappointed enlightenment thinker 
Why after virtue?
Virtue (Aristotle).  (For Hobbes it is massive confusion from the clear interest)
Macintyre thinks that Aristotelian tradition needs to be revived and adapted for contemporary purpose.
Karl Stevenson (critic of Hume’s, in transition of classical to Neo-classical utilitarianism, the classical utilitarians had no problem with interpersonal judgements of utility, Hume is not that sure, but he thinks that most people are alike, focus on what’s good for one people, interpersonal compare isn’t a issue; Stevenson said that maybe people are not fundamentally alike in the kind of moral judgements that they make) 

Stevenson’s Emotivism 
Ethical sentences express emotional attitudes, not propositions
Moral arguments are exercises in persuasive definition
The hurray!/boo! theory of morality 
Emotivist Culture
Rawls’ enduring pluralism (Starts with the assumption that we have fundamentally different values, never reconcile, Rousseau’s social contract, theory of taking men as they are and laws as they might be. They don’t agree on fundamental moral questions) 
Neo-classical denial of ICU(interpersonal compare of utility)
Stevenson’s emotivism
Nozick’s right-as-side constraints
All means abandonment of the virtues

Instrumental rationale

Symptoms: Affirmative action.  (Abortion, Nuclear disarmament)CNN crossfire
If people are really emotivist, yeah boo morality culture, not expected to persuade, why are they going through the forms of rational arguments? Challenge  other’s logic and be more cogent? Why this ritual of rational argument and reason giving and citing evidence and changeling other's ????

Mclntyre : We have an expectation about moral argument that our practice doesn’t deliver on. We engage in forms of moral judgements because we inherited a tradition which is basically being dismembered. We’ve inherited bits and pieces of a tradition in which it was completely accepted that people can be persuaded in moral arguments. But we/ve also detached those strands of the tradition from the unifying assumptions about human nature that gave them their point. And so we’ve inherited sort of incoherent pieces of a once coherent world view. Reason why people engage in this argument is because it’s a kind of performative illustration of the dissatisfaction with the enlightenment has brought. Enlightenment culture finally produce this emotivist culture which we all act out, live in, participate in.  Deeply we are uncomfortable  in this yeah boo theory of morality. Understand historically.

Paradox: this cognitive dissonance, society-wide scale in that nobody expects to persuade anybody of anything in this emotivist culture.(Charles Stevenson)

Basic choice: Aristotle or Nietzsche
(Nietzsche: Good and evil， Nihilism？？？)

Practice: Any coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity through which goods internal to that activity are realised. (How to fit in a community, internalise)

Virtue: (moral philosophy, Nicomachean Ethics) An acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which tends to enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices and the lack of which effectively prevents us from achieving any such good. —After virtue. （Pitcher’s Pitch; Hegel, The Phenomenology of Spirit, where he talks about different social forms of social orgnizatins, etc master slave society unstable, master dissatisfying wants recognition from sb regards as equal, as sb worth getting recognition from, master not from slaves. Be affirmed by people we value, and we would value within a practice cuz they understand them inside.）Virtues are embedded in practices, in order to understand and do well, we respect those goods, subordinate to the practices and excel. (Who set the virtues up? Nobody, we are by natural constitution, historical creatures, we start from where we are, we don’t start from some magical choice about where we would like to go)

### Communitarianism

> I think, therefore I am.                     -----  Rene Descartes Cogito (1596-1650)

All about me, me, me, The individual was the centre of Enlightenment story.

> I am because we are, and since we are, therefore I am      ----John S. MBiti, Ubuntu alternative  

Only discover your identity by reference to you group into which you were born and see that group perceives your identity. Group and community comes before, defines the individual.

** Hope Ubantu wasn't corrupted by the Enlightenment project !!! **
